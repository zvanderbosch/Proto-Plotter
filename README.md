# Proto Plotter 3000

An interactive tool for performing by-eye fits of one- or two-component blackbody functions to the spectral energy distrubutions (SEDs) of real proto-planetary disk systems.

This tool was initially designed as an educational tool for inquiry based learning activities, as part of the UC Santa Cruz's Institute for Scientist & Engineer Educators (ISEE) Professional Development Program (PDP).
